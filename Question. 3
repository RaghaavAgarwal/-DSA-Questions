Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:
1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if not strs:
            return ""

        for i in range(len(strs[0])):  # Loop through characters of first word
            char = strs[0][i]
            for s in strs[1:]:
                if i >= len(s) or s[i] != char:
                    return strs[0][:i]  # Return prefix up to this point

        return strs[0]  # All characters matched
